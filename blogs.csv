1,Wellness,"<p>Wellness can be described and defined in many ways. Merriam-Webster refers to wellness as “the state of being in good health, especially as an actively pursued goal.” The Global Wellness Institute defines wellness as “the active pursuit of activities, choices, and lifestyles that lead to a state of holistic health” (Global Wellness Institute, 2022), while the National Wellness Institute considers wellness to be “an active process through which people become aware of, and make choices toward, a more successful existence” (National Wellness Institute, 2022).</p>
<p>The verbiage used to define what wellness is as a concept or state of being may differ between sources and organizations, but there are common threads tying each definition together: a process, the active pursuit and lifestyle choices.  </p>
<p>The Many Dimensions of Wellness-Wellness is a concept that means something different to everyone. It is fluid and requires a continuous commitment and renewal of that commitment. Wellness is not only described differently by various sources, but the dimensions which make up one’s personal picture of wellness are also diverse.Dr. Bill Hettler, cofounder of the National Wellness Institute, first described wellness as a six-sided model in 1976. The dimensions originally included were emotional, occupational, physical, social, intellectual and spiritual (NWI). You can find a full description of each of these six dimensions here. Though other models exist and include additional dimensions (financial and environmental, for example), there is common ground between all: to be well or achieve optional wellness requires a balance or harmony between multiple facets of human existence that transcend the physical body (or health).Every wellness model appears to acknowledge (and respect) the interconnectedness of each component, regardless of how those components are labeled or defined. For example, when one area suffers, all remaining dimensions are negatively impacted. The reverse is true as well. When one area is fulfilled, all other components benefit. Wellness is a holistic state or pursuit that considers the complexity of human nature and needs.</p>
<p>Paint Your Picture of Wellness-Fortunately, wellness, like art, is subjective; wellness is a picture we can paint for ourselves with respect to our individual lives and the areas we deem valuable and consider priorities. Further, how we imagine wellness on an individual level varies from how our family members, friends and colleagues see their respective pictures of wellness.
So, where do you begin? How do you prepare to paint your personal picture of wellness? First, identify what it is you already have that relates to the dimensions that are important to you. Then, evaluate how “colorful” or fulfilled each area is. Finally, define what elements you need to complete your picture. For example, what “colors” are missing? What actions will you take to add those missing colors or pieces?</p>
<p>Before painting your masterpiece, begin by reflecting on and addressing these five prompts:
When I think about wellness, what images, symbols, or words come to mind? For example, when I think about wellness, the infinity symbol comes to mind. I view wellness as a process that we commit to at the beginning of every day. By asking yourself this question, your most valued dimensions may emerge based on the words and images that enter your mind.
When I think about my life in terms of work, home and personal, how balanced do I feel? What barriers affect me in achieving my desired level of balance?
When I think about joy, what things, activities, people or places bring me joy?
What occupies my headspace daily? Here you may identify what detracts from your joy.
When I think about myself as a whole person—mind, body, spirit—what area appears lacking? Why?</p>", Dr. Erin Nitschke,Blogs/1.jpg
2,Self Care at Home,"<p>In recent years, it seems as though we’ve finally begun to understand the importance of self-care and taking time out to look after ourselves. With burnout on the rise, this is more important than ever — you may talk about self care, but do you prioritise your mental and physical health as much as you should? If the answer is no, this guide is the motivator you need to take some time for you, with eight uncomplicated ways to relax, unwind and engage in self care at home.</p><p>Do A Home Workout-An obvious but essential starting point for self care is making sure you get some exercise in. There are countless home workouts you can do from your living room, many of which are free to access. Try a YouTube sweat session or Instagram live with your favourite fitness coach to make your workout more fun and engaging. The key is to find something you enjoy, whether it’s yoga, dance, boxing or barre. Even 10-15 minutes of exercise will get your endorphins flowing and boost your mood.</p>
<p>Reconnect With Nature-Have you taken the time to get outside lately? A simple dose of fresh air and sunlight will do you the world of good, whether it’s a walk around the block or a trip to your favourite park. Spending time in nature can improve your mood, reduce feelings of stress and help you feel more relaxed.</p><p>Have A Bubble Bath-If you’re the type of person who loves a bath, carving some time out of your day to enjoy this simple activity can help you relax and have a positive effect on your mental health. Use your favourite bubble bath, light a candle and switch off for a while as you soak in the hot water.</p><p>Start A New Hobby-Starting a new hobby gives you some time each week to focus on an activity you enjoy, helping you remain present so that stressful thoughts can leave the mind. Hobbies also give you a creative outlet, keep the brain active and help you build new skills. Whether you take up baking, learn to paint or make your own skincare at home, a new hobby will give you the time to wind down and calm your mind.</p><p>Cook A Nourishing Meal-Good nutrition is a key component of self care at home, and your body and mind will thank you for eating nourishing meals. The act of cooking something nutritious for yourself is rewarding — try to slow down and enjoy the process of cooking, really thinking about what you’re putting into your food and your body.</p><p>Try Meditation-You might be unsure whether meditation is for you, but why not give it a try? Meditation is an excellent way to clear your head and help yourself feel calmer, even if you don’t have loads of free time to dedicate to it. To get started, try setting a timer for two minutes, sit comfortably and close your eyes. Focus on deep breathing, let your thoughts come and go and see how you feel at the end of your session. If you enjoyed the process, try again for a little longer next time — you could even incorporate some relaxing music to get you in the right headspace.</p><p>Stay Hydrated-It might sound boring, but drinking two litres of water a day is great for your mind and body. Do yourself a favour and commit to this simple self care task every day.</p><p>Read A Book-Reading a book (or listening to an audiobook) is an excellent way to enjoy some “me” time. Give your brain some time to relax and focus on something else, and you’ll be amazed at how refreshed you can feel afterwards. If your “to-read” pile only ever seems to get bigger, this is the ideal self care activity for you.</p>",BY LOUISE SMITHSON,Blogs/2.jpg
3,Physical Inactivity & Covid-19 Severity,"<p>The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recently released updated information about people who are at increased risk of becoming very sick from COVID-19 due to having one or more health conditions. Included on that list of health conditions—alongside things like cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), type 1 and type 2 diabetes and heart disease—is physical inactivity.
According to the CDC, “People who do little or no physical activity, or exercise, are more likely to get very sick from COVID-19 than those who are physically active.”</p><p>Physical inactivity often contributes to weight gain and increased fat mass, which can lead to several other conditions on the CDC’s list, including overweight, obesity and type 2 diabetes. The underlying fact is that being physically active contributes significantly to overall health and well-being.</p><p>Physical activity is important for-Reducing the risk of chronic conditions: These include type 2 diabetes, heart disease and certain types of cancer.Improving mental health and cognitive function: In addition to improving mood and reducing feelings of anxiety, physical activity can reduce the risk of depression and of developing dementia.Sleep quality: Insufficient sleep has been linked to the development of many of the chronic diseases and conditions on the above-referenced list.Immune function: This is an area of emerging research, but evidence suggests physical activity may also boost immune function.</p><p>After reviewing research of COVID-19 severity, the CDC found evidence of increased risk of several COVID-19 outcomes among people who were inactive, including hospitalization, ventilation and death, so we can now add “reducing the risk of severe COVID-19” to the seemingly endless list of reasons to live an active lifestyle.</p>",Cedric X.

4,Healthy Postpatrum Immune System,"<p>From the moment you find out you’re pregnant, you do everything in your power to keep your baby healthy, which includes keeping yourself in good condition. You form some healthier habits and kick out some bad ones. You take good care of your body, as that was necessary for the wellbeing of your child. However, you should know that, once you give birth, it’s easy to start neglecting yourself and concentrating solely on your little cherub. It’s essential that you don’t let this happen, since your body is still sensitive and in distress from giving birth, and you should do whatever you can to allow it to recover and heal properly. The ideal place to start is your immune system, so that you can stay in optimum shape for yourself and your baby and avoid getting ill. Here are some ways to improve your postpartum immune response.</p><p>Tend To Your Mental Health-Once you bring a baby into this world, you’ll probably experience an overwhelming mixture of emotions, ranging from euphoria to melancholy and despair. You’ll go through hormonal changes and you’ll often feel stressed. This is something you need to address, since your stress can affect your immune system and weaken it. It would be beneficial if you could focus on something that calms you down and makes you happy. For many mothers, this is their new baby, which makes it perfectly fine to watch them sleep, hug them and touch them whenever the opportunity arises. On the other hand, there are women who will benefit from talking to other adults, such as their partner, siblings or friends. In case you need this kind of contact, reach out to those you love and tell them what’s bothering you. Social isolation in the postpartum period can cause desolation, which is why you should stay in touch with people, at least through phone calls or text messages, but eye-to-eye contact is always the best option. Perhaps you’ll relax after taking a shower, being that it doesn’t only come down to personal hygiene, but also allows you to spend some time alone. If none of these ideas work for you and you don’t think you can handle the anxiety, talk to your MD or a mental-health professional and ask for their opinion.</p><p>Eat Well-The food you choose to eat after you’ve given birth matters greatly, as it directly influences your health, but also your baby’s, especially if you’re breastfeeding. In order to keep your postpartum immune system in order, you’ll need to supply your body with several different nutrients through food or supplementation. For instance, you’ll need plenty of iron, which you can get from red meat or green leafy vegetables. Next, you’ll need vitamin B12 and you’ll find it in tuna, liver, cereals or fortified dairy, but you’ll also want to increase your vitamin D levels, since this is vital to your immune system. As far as food goes, some good sources of vitamin D are orange juice, egg yolks and fatty fish, such as salmon and tuna. Make sure you eat fresh fruit and vegetables, and if you need snacks, don’t settle for anything less than highly nutritious healthy products. Some excellent examples are shiitake mushroom and various veggie chips, as well as beetroot slices or dried mango. If you don’t have the time to go shopping for this type of food, don’t hesitate to order it online and have it delivered to your front door. Purchasing these kinds of snacks instead of the regular salted and unhealthy ones can improve your immune response and be your ally in keeping yourself and your newborn healthy.</p><p>Get Out And Walk-Taking care of a baby will take a lot of your time and energy. It’s likely you’ll feel extremely tired from time to time. Nevertheless, you need to remember that fresh air and physical exercise are crucial to your postpartum immune system and your overall well-being. Taking walks will cover both, without you overexerting yourself in the process. Walking is a light exercise, one that promotes better circulation and clears your mind, ridding you of at least one part of the stress you’re feeling. Another issue that many mothers face after giving birth is the amount of time they spend indoors. While it’s true that you have to adjust to your parenting role and get back on your feet, stepping outside regularly can only do your immune system good, so find the time and the will to take a stroll in the nearby park or around the neighborhood. These walks don’t have to be long. Half an hour a day will do the trick, and it’s something that most women can manage. If you can leave your baby with your somebody, that’s fine, but if not, you can always put them in their stroller and take them with you.</p>

5,Fibre - Essential for Daily Intake,"<p>The early onset of diabetes during childhood, particularly type 2 diabetes, is becoming a growing healthcare concern in the United States. Currently, nearly 100 million Americans are estimated to have diabetes or are believed to be at extreme risk for developing diabetes (prediabetes). Additionally, an estimated 132,000 of these cases have been diagnosed in children and adolescents younger than 18 (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2017).
Historically, when children were diagnosed with diabetes, it was most often insulin-dependent type 1 diabetes, which is caused by an autoimmune disease that shuts down the body’s ability to make insulin. By contrast, type 2 diabetes has traditionally been termed “adult-onset” because its prevalence is highly impacted by diet, activity levels and lifestyle-related factors.</p><p>Currently, type 2 diabetes is growing at a rate of roughly 5,000 new cases per year in youth and adolescents (Lawrence et al., 2014), and the diagnosis of type 2 diabetes in this population has increased more than 30% in the last 10 years (Dabelea et al., 2014).It appears that the increasing rates of type 2 diabetes in children could be yet another health concern stemming from the broader childhood obesity epidemic. Physical inactivity, poor diet and excess body fat have been identified as risk factors for type 2 diabetes in both adults and children (Copeland, 2011). Children who are in the 85th percentile or higher for BMI are more than four times more likely to develop type 2 diabetes (Abbasi et al., 2017). Currently, this represents roughly one in three children (Ogden et al., 2014).</p><p>The Mechanisms Behind Type 2 Diabetes-One of the primary mechanisms behind type 2 diabetes appears to be a decrease in insulin sensitivity (Hannon and Arslanian, 2015). When tissues and cells lose sensitivity to insulin, the result is damage to the metabolic infrastructure that helps regulate blood sugar levels. When elevated blood sugar becomes chronic, it creates a variety of acute and longitudinal medical complications. The risk factors listed in the paragraph above significantly contribute to a reduction in insulin sensitivity (Copeland et al., 2011).Medical complications stemming from type 2 diabetes include microalbuminuria, hypertension, kidney disease, dyslipidemia, and neuropathy. Advanced levels of these complications generally appear about 10 years from diagnosis (Hannon, Arslanian, 2015). This could significantly increase risks for morbidity and mortality during the most productive years of life when kids grow up to join the workforce and have families. It also prolongs the physical and financial toll brought on by the disease. </p><p>How to Reduce a Child’s Risk of Developing Type 2 Diabetes-Clearly, an increase in the prevalence of type 2 diabetes in children has future implications for the nation’s workforce and healthcare system, as well as individual health and happiness. The good news is that through basic lifestyle modification, a child’s risk of developing type 2 diabetes and the associated health complications can be significantly decreased.</p><p>To turn the tide on this disturbing trend, a variety of recommendations are provided by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (2017):Replace the consumption of sugary drinks with water,Eat more fruits and vegetables,Involve children in the preparation of healthy meals,Eat meals at the table instead of in front of the television or individually in a room,Teach kids about food labels,Eat together as a family,Serve smaller portions,Facilitate 60 minutes of activity daily,Involve children in sports,It’s also recommended that parents of  talk to their pediatricians about the risks for developing type 2 diabetes, so early action can halt progression of the disease. </p>",Peter Jaret,Blogs/5.jpg
6,Bloating,"<p>Social distancing (or physical distancing) has us all experiencing many changes, including what we eat, how much we exercise and how we go about our day-to-day routines. With so much change happening at once, it’s no wonder we sometimes have symptoms we don’t normally have, and that includes bloating.Bloating is a feeling that your stomach feels uncomfortably full. Some people describe bloating as a feeling that they have a balloon in their belly. Often times, bloating will go away on its own. But if it lingers, here are some common causes I tell my patients and ways to relieve the discomfort at home.
It could be constipation,Hormones may be the culprit,Excess gas can build up,Eating more calories than usual,A more serious condition, such as irritable bowel syndrome</p> <p>1) It could be constipation-While you’re spending a lot of time at home, you may not be moving as much as you usually do. You may also be eating different foods. This can lead to constipation. You may be constipated if you experience:Fewer bowel movements than normal for you,Stool that is lumpy or looks like pebbles,Difficulty passing stool or a feeling that you still need to go after you’re finished,Fortunately, you can make a number of at-home changes to help relieve your constipation. These include:Mix up your diet,Try stool softeners or fiber supplements,Don’t forget to work out.</p><p>2) Hormones may be the culprit-Women may experience bloating, abdominal pain and cramps just before and during their period. This is normal and usually due to hormonal changes that regulate the menstrual cycle. If you’re bloating just before your period, try the following prevention methods:
Eat low-sodium foods,Drink water-Fill a water bottle and sip on it throughout the day. Drinking water actually helps you flush your system of excess salt and water that may lead to bloating during your period. Aim for 48 to 64 ounces of water per day. Avoid alcohol-Drinking alcohol affects your sleep cycle, which in turn leads to inflammation and swelling. Excess alcohol can also cause diarrhea, which contributes to bloating and abdominal pain. In the days leading up to your period, replace alcohol with decaffeinated tea or water. Exercise regularly-Even low-impact exercise like walking and yoga can help you break a sweat and release powerful feel-good chemicals. You might also consider taking a class online or try some creative ways to get your daily steps in.</p>
<p>3)Excess gas can build up-Gas is a normal part of digestion, but if it builds up in your intestines, it may cause bloating and pain. Gas happens when food that is not digested is broken down in your colon. This process produces methane and hydrogen, which you pass naturally as gas.If you do experience bloating due to gas, modifying your food intake may help. Here are some common drinks and foods that can cause bloating:Foods high in fiber or fat,
Fried and spicy dishes,Carbonated drinks, such as soda or beer,Lactose found in milk, cheese and yogurts,Over-the-counter supplements can even trigger bloating.</p><p>4) Eating more calories than usualLet’s face it. When you’re off your schedule, sometimes the most interesting thing you can do is bake. But consuming excess calories — especially those found in cookies, cakes and bread — can pack on the pounds and cause your belly to bloat. If cooking is your jam while sheltering in place, reserve high-calorie recipes for special occasions, or cut it back to one meal a week.</p><p>A more serious condition, such as irritable bowel syndromeIrritable bowel syndrome, or IBS, is a common condition that causes abdominal pain with bloating, diarrhea or constipation. The cause of IBS is unknown, but it may be brought on by certain triggers, including:Bacterial infections,Food sensitivity,Stressful events</p>",Pamela Reif,Blogs/6.jpg
7,5 Ways To Beat The Winter Blues,"<p>1. GOOD LIGHTING-One of the biggest aspects of the warmer months that I miss, is the longer hours of sunshine and light. I just love seeing sunshine pour into the windows of my apartment, and especially in the early hours of the day when I’m doing my morning routine. In the winter however, when I wake up around 6am, it is dark. Very, very DARK. It also tends to get dark very early as well when I’m still busy working and wanting to be productive.To offset this, I light up my apartment by turning on enough lights to make it feel like day time, as well as my oil diffuser which has a warm yellow light as well (I use mood boosting citrus essential oils like lemon, grapefruit, orange and bergamot – LOVE these and would highly recommend!). Having lights on instantly helps to lift my mood by seeing that it’s brighter at home.Of course in the evening when I am winding down, I turn down the lights to be softer, but during the day time this is essential! On this note, when it actually IS a sunny day outside, I love to wrap myself up real warm, and get outside for a walk!</p><p>2. WORKING OUT-One of the BIGGEST mood enhancers is definitely exercising. I rely on this even more so during the colder months as it literally gets your own warmth and internal fire reved-up. Working out releases lots of good mood boosting chemicals including endorphins, which trigger a positive feeling in the body, similar to that of morphine! When in motion, our bodies are literally producing a pharmacy of feel good chemicals, and we feel the effects of these long after the workout is finished.As some of you may know, I believe in doing some type of movement DAILY. It doesn’t have to be an hour long session at the gym (it can be, but not necessary for everyday). Getting in a 20 minutes at-home pilates or yoga session works great too (you can do a YouTube search for great classes!). Or you can always take your workout outdoors by going on a walk or a hike. The point is to get your body intentionally moving most days out of the week.Working out is also amazing for lowering stress and anxiety overall, it’s great for building self esteem and self confidence, it increases energy, improves sleep quality, lowers blood pressure, strengthens and tones your muscles and is just an incredible self-care practice.</p>
<p>3. PERSPECTIVE & GRATITUDE-I once read an article about how for the most part, children don’t judge the weather. It’s very rare you’ll hear a little child complaining that it’s raining or cold. Children tend to be more accepting and less judgmental. Having younger siblings in my family, I immediately saw how this was true.  It’s funny because the weather is like it is, and us complaining about it will not make it better. It will only make it worse, and remind ourselves how much the cold bothers us. Even though it’s difficult to be totally un-judgemental about the weather, it’s definitely something I try to practice more and more.Instead of complaining about the weather, finding little things to be grateful for can totally change your day around. For instance, something that is special this time of year, is how cozy you can make yourself feel by bundling up in warm clothes, scarfs, hats and boots. Cuddling up on the couch with a warm blanket, either alone or with a loved one, with a warm cup of tea in hand, is a feeling that is priceless. Embracing and not trying to change or control that which we cannot, is a huge life lesson that can be applied to lots of other areas in life.</p>
<p>4. A WARM JACKET-This brings me on to my next point, which is to invest in a great warm winter jacket! The puffier and cozier, the better! ?? Know that it’s going to be cold, so without only thinking about fashion, also embrace the comfort and warmth factor. There are lots of great coats and puffers these days that are both warm and stylish. I recently got this black one from Zara which I love and this beige teddy coat from Mango is also amazing! Woolrich also have really great high quality coats that will definitely keep you warm!</p>
<p>5. LISTEN TO A GUIDED MEDITATION / PODCAST-It’s so good to keep the good vibes flowing, especially when the weather is taking a toll on your mood and energy levels. I love starting my day with a few minutes of meditation. I do this after I’ve had my warm water with lemon, and been to the bathroom (watch this video here on why this is so important). I feel light and clear, and then I grab my headphones and sit down in my living room. I like to do a simple guided meditation, usually lasting 10 minutes. I focus on my breath and try to stay present in the moment. Meditation has been shown to lower anxiety and stress, boost mindfulness during the day, increase productivity and so much more… plus it’s free and can be easily incorporated a few minutes everyday.
Podcasts are also great! </p>

8,My Favorite Thing about Yoga,"<p>What I Love Most About Yoga -
There are so many things I love about yoga.What I fell in love with initially was the physical practice. I walked into my first ever yoga studio in Sactown when I was 15 years old and it was hook, line and sinker.I told myself I would go back every day for the rest of my life, and give or take a few days (plus a lot of days in the beginning of college, because… well, college) I have held up that agreement with myself.
That first ever day in the studio is when I became a diehard yogi. I was attracted to the mind, body, spirit element of the practice, but at that time it was mainly the physical aspect that I was hyper-focused on. I wanted to learn all of the poses and do all of the things. I wanted to have the “yoga butt,” the yoga abs, and all around tap into my strongest physical body through the practice.But even going all the way back to that FIRST CLASS — basketball shorts and all, dripping in sweat, my heart bursting open with a crazy feeling of gratitude & love during Savasana that I had never before experienced anything like it — I always knew it was about so much more than the physical.The physical element was just a vehicle for what I really experienced deep down… an inner peace that was simply indescribable until I learned more.True peace. Calm. Mind, body, spirit awareness. An awareness of a universe so far outside of myself and beyond myself. Beyond everything I was dealing with at the time, from my then-boyfriend’s recent suicide attempt (just three days before that first ever yoga class, actually) to just coming into my own as a human and trying to figure it all out. I was going through some major shit on the inside. </p>

<p>The Beauty of Savasana & Meditation-
I recently took an hour and fifteen minute vinyasa class that ended with a full fifteen minute Savasana.
FIFTEEN MINUTES of pure bliss and rest after working our muscles to the bone.
I can’t even tell you how needed and amazing that experience was for me on that particular day. With Venus in retrograde and a LOT OF STUFF happening in my life these past few weeks (like my ebook coming out!! ahhh!!) I was in serious need of some true relaxation and zen vibes.
Those fifteen minutes allowed me to sink in and dig deep in a very meditative kind of way. I nearly had an out of body experience, which never is able to happen in the usual 2-3 minute Savasanas in most vinyasa classes in Los Angeles.
It’s like I saw my life moving in slow motion and could pick out the things that were causing me stress and basically choose to eliminate them. I had control over my mind — power over the fluctuations of the mindstuff (thanks Patanjali :)).
Directly after that, I had the MOST POWERFUL experience with my girlfriends from High Vibe Livin (they will be on the podcast next week!!!) doing an angel card reading and a kundalini meditation. You can see more of that experience here in my new VLOG from last week on my YouTube channel!
Basically, we connected huge time about how much I need to open up blocked energy in my life and in my heart by continuing my spiritual practice and continuing this yoga journey so far beyond the physical. And being unafraid to do so and really big deep within.I am so looking forward to diving deeper and learning more about Kundalini in the coming months — I had a rough weekend emotionally this weekend (thanks again to all of the planets in retrograde…) and ALL I could think was that strengthening my intuition and my connection to my core via Kundalini and meditation is exactly what I needed.
To maintain that power and control over my mind.
Because when we have that power and control, we can greatly reduce our own suffering. And find inner peace.
Just like I did on that very first day of yoga in Sacramento (in my basketball shorts ;)). </p>",BalanceBlonde,Blogs/8.jpg
9,Intuitive Eating,"<p>Fad diets, chronic dieting, and restrictive ways of eating can promote an unhealthy relationship with food. Food is meant to be nourishing and enjoyable. Here at PUL, we practice what has been coined as intuitive eating: a more wholesome and sustainable approach to eating. Let's explore what intuitive eating means, its benefits, the 10 core principles, and how we can put it into practice.</p>
<p>Defining intuitive eating-Intuitive eating is an approach to eating that focuses on being in tune with our body cues related to hunger, such as hunger itself, fullness, and satisfaction. Rather than following a set of rules, intuitive eating emphasizes trusting the signs our body tells us related to what we eat when we eat, and how much we eat. Being aware of and trusting our intuition makes up a big part of intuitive eating. </p>

<p>Why intuitive eating-It's hard to avoid diet culture, especially from the media. This can set us up for negative emotions surrounding our body image and the foods we eat. In the long term, restrictive dieting doesn't lead to sustainable weight loss and if anything, can lead to more weight gain. On the other hand, an approach that appreciates health at every size has been found to have both psychological and physical benefits.</p>
 
<p>Here are some examples:
Intuitive eating has been associated with greater emotional functioning and decreased disordered eating,
We can increase our awareness of what we're eating and why by practicing intuitive eating. This allows us to become more mindful when it comes to our meals,
Intuitive eating provides a way to reduce dieting patterns and enable more sustainable, long-term behaviours,
Engaging in intuitive eating has been correlated with an increased motivation to engage in exercise, especially for pleasure purposes,
The more appreciation we have for our bodies, the more happiness we tend to experience. In intuitive eaters, higher levels of body appreciation and lower levels of body image concerns have been found,
Overall, the most sustainable approach to healthy eating is eating in a way that's enjoyable rather than restrictive. Intuitive eating provides an approach that's flexible and is able to be adopted by everyone</p>",PickUp Limes,Blogs/9.jpg
10,Controlling BloodPressure in Winters,"<p>As the temperature dips in winters, it brings with it a whole host of great things – stylish winter wear, great food, but, it also brings some troubles – dry skin, chapped lips, high blood pressure. Wait, you didn’t know that your blood pressure spikes in the winters? Don’t hit the panic button yet, we’ll tell you why your blood pressure spikes and we will also talk about 7 easy tips to keep blood pressure under control in winters.
The reason why blood pressure increases in winters is because our blood vessels and arteries narrow down and the body struggles to push the blood through them. This results in increased blood pressure which is associated with health complications like heart diseases and kidney diseases. If you or your loved ones suffer from blood pressure, you’ve got to be extra careful during these months. So, the tips discussed below might help you:</p>

 

<p>Workout during winters -
We understand that it’s a pain to work out in the freezing weather and it doesn’t help that your blanket is so cozy and warm. However, to keep the heart-healthy, it is important to exercise. It is not necessary for you to engage in exercises that demand a lot of effort. A simple morning walk or light cardiovascular exercises will also do the job. If you have the luxury of time, you can avoid the cold and work out a little late when it is a bit warmer. This will also help in preventing extra stress on the heart.</p>

 

<p>Avoid breathing in cold air-
Our lungs work best when they get a certain level of warm and wet air. Inhaling cold and dry air irritates them and they react to it by causing pain. Thus, you need to be careful while going out when it’s cold. If you really have to go out then cover your nose and mouth well with a scarf. That will help in warming the air a little. If you are habitual of working out in the morning and are continuing to do so then warm up before indulging in heavy exercises. This will prepare your lungs to deal with incoming cold air.</p>

 

<p>Dress in layers-
Layering is a great idea – both for your style and health (added benefit of hiding that bulge!). For your outer layer, choose a high-quality jacket that will block the air and moisture. Wear a sweater or sweatshirt as the middle layer. They will act as an insulator and will keep you warm. Choose your base or inner layer a little carefully. Cottons are great for summers but their moisture-absorbing quality isn’t good for winters. Go for materials like polyester which will keep the moisture away from your skin. Good quality gloves, scarves and shoes will also help.</p>

 

<p>Nutrient rich food -
Avoid foods with heavy calories.
Eating right during winter is the key to beat the cold and maintain normal blood pressure. Don’t load up on calories that are beyond what your body needs on a daily basis. The extra calories you’ll consume will end up getting accumulated in your body in the form of fat which takes extra effort to burn. Also, make sure that your diet has ample amount of fruits and vegetables.</p>

 

<p>Take special care of elderly
Elderly people are more at risk of high blood pressure and cardiac conditions during winter. Special care should be taken of them. Make sure they are wearing enough warm clothes, eating well and are not putting any kind of pressure on their heart. If you notice any changes in their health then without any delay get their health checkup done. The health checkups will also help in understanding their overall health better as both elder men and women can have different health concerns.</p>

 

<p>Keep medications handy-
If you already have any kind of lung disease, heart disease or suffer from high blood pressure frequently, then keep all the medications handy in this weather. A point to note here is that always make sure your medications are prescribed by your doctor. Do not consume any medicine that you ‘think’ would help.</p>

 

<p>Get regular health checkups-
The simplest way to avoid any medical emergency is to regularly get health checkups done, especially during winters. These checkups will alert you in advance of developing any disease or any kind of deficiency that could cause trouble in the near future. That way you’ll have enough time to act and be safe.</p>

11,Guide to Balance Diet,"<p>
Balanced diet is a key to stay healthy. Follow the ""Healthy Eating Food Pyramid"" guide as you pick your food. Grains should be taken as the major dietary source. Eat more fruit and vegetables. Have a moderate amount of meat, fish, egg, milk and their alternatives. Reduce salt, fat/ oil and sugar. Trim fat from meat before cooking. Choose low-fat cooking methods such as steaming, stewing, simmering, boiling, scalding or cooking with non-stick frying pans. Also reduce the use of frying and deep-frying. These can help us achieve balanced diet and promote health.
</p>
 
<p>
 Eat the Right Food-
Since different foods have different nutritional values, it is not possible to obtain all the nutrients we need from a single food. According to the Healthy Eating Food Pyramid, we have to eat a variety of foods among all food groups as well as within each group in order to get different nutrients and meet our daily needs.
</p>
<p> 
Eat the Right Amount-
Neither eating too much nor too little is good for our health. Every day, we need a specific amount of nutrients to maintain optimal health. If we do not eat enough, under-nutrition and symptoms of deficiency are likely to develop; while over-nutrition and obesity can be resulted when we consume an excessive amount of any type of food. Therefore, we have to eat right amount of food to stay healthy.</p>

12,Healthcare  With Self-Care,"<p>When Dr. Reena Kotecha found herself having a panic attack in the cereal aisle of a supermarket, she knew something was wrong. As a doctor, she was used to diagnosing and treating others, but when it came to herself, she found that she had “a personal blind spot.”“As a healthcare professional you hold this identity of: I am the caregiver, not the caretaker. I’m meant to be the ‘strong one’—the one who’s got it all figured out,” she says.</p>

<p>The Importance of Self-Care-
By chance, she met a woman who became her meditation teacher, and from there everything began to shift. “When I first sat down with her, I just cried for the first 20 minutes,” she recounts. “And while most people would ask, ‘what’s wrong with you?’ she just said, ‘Shall we take a few breaths?’ And, you know, in those moments, I felt a little lighter.”</p>

<p>In medical school, Dr. Kotecha learned about the human body, but she wasn’t taught an important lesson: how to listen to it.
“I was trained in anatomy and physiology and pharmacology and looking after others. But no one ever trained me, or suggested that it would be important, to look after myself in the process,” Dr. Kotecha says. So, with the belief that “health care starts with self-care,” Dr. Kotecha started Mindful Medics, a training program that promotes health and well-being, and professional productivity and engagement through mindfulness, compassion, emotional intelligence, medicine, and neuroscience.</p>

<p>You Are Not Alone-
“I know what it’s like to feel so lonely and so isolated and so dejected—caring for others while feeling like you are running out of capacity—which has been exacerbated by the pandemic,” Dr. Kotecha says. “The support that healthcare professionals need is not just physical PPE, but mental and emotional support as well. Mindful Medics helps provide skillful space for healthcare professionals to share and reflect on what they’ve seen throughout the day and have someone just listen or guide them through a practice to find some calm. This is what drives me—supporting healthcare professionals so that they’re able to not just do their best work, but show up with optimal mental and emotional health.</p>",OYINDA LAGUNJU,Blogs/12.jpg
13,Anxiety,"
<p>Anxiety describes the emotion of fear, which occurs on a spectrum that ranges from mildly nervous or worried to the extremes of feeling completely panicked. Anxiety can be normal when it is situational, meaning it occurs in response to a specific situation and goes away on its own when the situation is resolved.Fear is not a “rational” emotion, so even normal anxiety sometimes seems like an overreaction, but frequent anxiety that is excessive or unexplainable is abnormal. The symptoms of anxiety disorders vary depending on the type, but experiencing worried, racing or catastrophic thoughts are common, and increased irritability, restlessness, and nervous energy are as well. Many people experience physical symptoms when they become anxious including increases in their heart rate, blood pressure and respiration.</p>

<p>Most symptoms of anxiety are a direct result of a normal chain reaction called the “fight or flight” response that involves the brain, nervous system, and body. A part of the brain called the amygdala is largely responsible for beginning this chain reaction, acting as a threat detector that cues the nervous system to activate. Once activated, the nervous system releases stress hormones and adrenaline into the bloodstream, causing physiological changes like increased heart rate, respiration, heightened awareness and a surge of energy.At one point in history, the fight or flight response helped humans survive in a world filled with external threats, but in today’s world, most of the “threats” that activate fight or flight are not external ones that people can run from or physically fight off. Because the amygdala hasn’t evolved a lot, it isn’t great at distinguishing between real and imagined threats and is prone to “false alarms.” People who struggle with anxiety disorders often experience more false alarms than others which could be a result of being more predisposed to anxiety by any number of biologic, environmental, social, and psychological factors.</p>


<p>Types of Anxiety Disorders-
Anxiety disorders describe a category of mental health conditions that share common symptoms, but have different patterns of onset, duration, and frequency. Many anxiety disorders are distinguished by the specific events and circumstances that trigger the symptoms or “false alarms” described above.</p>

<p>Some of the more common types of anxiety disorders include:

Generalized anxiety disorder (GAD): Symptoms of anxiety triggered by a wide range of circumstances, or sometimes for unknown reasons.
Social anxiety disorder: Symptoms of anxiety which occur in specific social interactions or settings where a person is afraid of being judged or rejected.
Specific phobias: Intense symptoms of anxiety triggered by a specific thing (i.e. fear of spiders), situations (i.e. heights), or activities (i.e. public speaking).
Panic disorder: An anxiety disorder characterized by panic attacks and intense fear about the possibility of future attacks.
Anxiety disorders related to an underlying health issue or are related to the effects of a prescribed or illicit substance
Separation Anxiety which primarily affects children (but can happen in adults) and is characterized by extreme anxiety when separated from loved ones (usually caregivers)
Unspecified Anxiety Disorders which includes some symptoms of anxiety that do not match other known anxiety disorders but do cause significant distress or impairment.
Obsessive compulsive disorder (OCD): Not technically an anxiety disorder, but characterized by high levels of anxiety, intrusive thoughts, and ritualistic behavior
Post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD): Not an anxiety disorder, but involves symptoms of anxiety, avoidance, mood problems, and recurrent memories following a traumatic experience</p>",Haliey Sharif,Blogs/13.jpg
14,Obesity,"<p>What Is Obesity?
To a layman, obesity means merely someone who is very fat, and this must be so because they eat a lot, don’t exercise and so on. However, this is not always the case. Obesity is a health condition in which an individual has accumulated too much body fat, and this fat has adverse effects on their health.</p>

<p>How Does One Determine If They Are ‘Obese’?
If an individual’s weight is 20% higher than the normal range, then this person is ‘obese.’ Also, when checking the BMI or the body mass index, if the individual’s BMI is between 25 and 29.9, they are known to be overweight. But if one’s BMI is 30 or crosses this mark, they fall into the obese category.</p>

<p>Importance Of BMI To Measure Obesity Health Risks?
BMI or the body mass index is a measurement, statistically derived by checking one’s weight and height. While it is an excellent way to estimate a healthy body weight, it does not let on the body fat percentage.Further, the BMI can be misleading too.</p>

<p>Obesity Health Risks On The Increase-
While one may argue on many accounts of being overweight or obese, the truth is that obesity is a huge health risk and it increasingly has become a concern for us Indians. As per research, it is said that by 2025, India will have the second-largest obese population in the world, i.e., 17 million people in the obese category, second only to China. Even after knowing these statistics and being aware enough of the health conditions, Obesity is on the increase.</p>

<p>Here Are Ten Things To Know About Obesity Health Risks:
What is worst is that Obesity affects children too. Childhood obesity will result in obesity in adulthood, and these individuals will be prone to various health issues as well.
As a significant health risk, obesity makes people susceptible to cardiovascular diseases, high blood pressure, stroke, type 2 diabetes, respiratory problems, gallbladder issues and even types of cancer.
Being obese is a social hazard as well. It affects one’s regular life with sleep problems, chronic body or back pain, osteoporosis and much more. An obese person will have difficulty in climbing stairs, have limited mobility and this will restrict their ability to exercise as well.
Obesity has emotional and mental repercussions as well. It causes a person to lose confidence in themselves, always thinking of themselves as not good enough. It can lead to depression and anxiety due to isolation.
Obesity also affects one’s fertility. Women who are overweight and obese have difficulty in getting pregnant and men who are obese, may not be able to produce healthy sperm for reproduction.
Obese people are not ‘obese’ by choice. While one of the reasons for being overweight and obese, is overeating, there are many factors involved.
Poor diet and food choices coupled with lack of physical exercise, social, cultural and even genetics, may lead to obesity.
Particular medications or medical issues can also make an individual obese.
Obesity needs to be more than only losing the excess weight. It requires a multi-faceted approach, making serious changes in one’s lifestyle, food habits and activities.
People need to work on their information on Obesity. They need to understand the health risks, complications and associated diseases with the condition.</p>",Pharmeasy,Blogs/14.png
15,Authentic SelfCare,"<p>Authentic self-care is for everyone. It’s what we all need and deserve, but it can be hard because it’s not a quick fix. Ironically, neither is our own inner journey, or something as lofty as social justice work. Seen this way, wellness is one aspect of social justice, and like social justice, wellness doesn’t happen overnight.</p>

<p>This is another reason that self-care has gotten such a bad name: It is much easier to practice “self-care” in easy ways that feel good right now than it is to develop the discipline of a healthy lifestyle that often sucks in the moment but feels really great later. Authentic self-care is not self-indulgence. Self-indulgence is unrestrained gratification of our desires and whims, behaviors meant only to alter our mood and provide a m temporary escape from pain and grief.</p>

<p>How can we tell the difference between self-indulgence and true acts of self-care? First, ask if what you’re doing is a temporary quick fix or something that is meant to yield long-term benefits. Sometimes, self-care is best expressed by setting limits in ways that prioritize what’s most important. This takes discipline. Some everyday examples might include watching only one episode of a TV show, not bingeing a whole season, so you get to bed at a decent hour and experience a full night’s rest. It might be not having a glass of wine with dinner, or only having one; saying no when you don’t want to do some- thing; or waking up early so you have extra time to meditate, journal, or exercise before work.</p>

<p>The morning when I wrote my own self-care list, which was my response to true despair and a will to survive, I felt an instinctual inner knowing that I had to give up most of my vices in order to truly dedicate myself to self-care, to my healing, and to my overall wellness. If the work we do in the world is larger than ourselves—and for me at that moment being a mother to my son was just that—then self- care means defining clear boundaries that help ensure our long-term physical, mental, and spiritual health. But I didn’t give up all my vices. I knew there were healthy indulgences I could still enjoy, ones that provided important moments of joy and happiness. For me, these were defined by even the smallest of actions that helped me restore balance during one of the most imbalanced periods in my life. This included things like spending an evening reading a good book with a mud mask on my face, shutting down my phone and not respond- ing to texts or emails for a few hours of solitude, and having a meal with a friend while engaging in meaningful conversation. I didn’t consider any of these things frivolous.</p>

<p>My point is this: Self-care is not one-size-fits-all. We each must decide what’s right for ourselves. The biggest challenge I needed to overcome was the guilt and ingrained belief that taking any time for myself was selfish. In the end, what I learned from this experience is that tending to myself is a way to reaffirm that I value myself, and because I do, I must also honor myself. Taking that time to reaffirm in writing that “I am not broken” set me on my path and positioned me front and center as my own cheer- leader and self-advocate. Yet I can also proclaim irrefutably that authentic self-care is a truly selfless act—one that made me into a healthier being, a more engaged mother, and eventually, an impassioned self-care activist.</p>", SHELLY TYGIELSKI,Blogs/15.jpg
16,Break a Habit with Neuroscience,"<p>
I’ve been struggling with my habits—trying to break some unhealthy ones, and make some healthier ones. I need some help staying the course though—why is this so hard?</p>

<p>
Let’s look at how the mind actually works when it comes to forming (and maintaining) habits. They have a simple, consistent formula: there’s a trigger, there’s an accompanying behavior, and there’s a result or reward.Being in habit mode is like being on autopilot. So, first gear is recognizing what our habits are. Paying attention is second gear—exploring and understanding the rewards that come from our behaviors.If we’re constantly checking our phones, for instance, we might compare the rewards of that behavior to how our live interactions with people feel. When we notice how our phones can pull our attention away from where we actually are, we might also notice that the reward value of checking our phones (say, every five minutes) diminishes further.
This is where mindfulness can help. So, what feels better? Responding to my phone? Or staying with the conversation I’m already in with this person sitting across from me?Once we start to examine relative rewards, we naturally begin to recalibrate and change our behavior. And it’s not from forcing ourselves to change. It emerges from bringing kind, curious awareness to what we’re experiencing to alter our relationship to these all-too-human experiences.</p>", JUDSON BREWER,Blogs/16.png
17,Mediatate for good living,"<p>When we’re under pressure, our ability to care and to lead can feel compromised. Mindfulness can provide a path to cultivate the focus and determination of grit and the care and calm of grace, to learn from growth and change. In this practice to arrive, breathe, and connect, Dr. Lili Powell, a professor at UVA Darden School of Business, offers space to fully arrive in the present moment and make a commitment to focusing on being right here, right now.</p>

<p>Get into what for you is an alert yet relaxed position. You may need to adjust your posture a bit to settle into your chair. Put your feet flat on the floor, put your bottom way back in the seat of your chair, and then sit up nice and tall. You can relax your hands, placing the palms down on top of your thighs. And then very slowly lower your gaze or, if you feel comfortable, close your eyes.</p>
<p>Take a moment to fully arrive in the present moment. You may be at work or doing something else right now, so I invite you to take a moment to put that aside. Of course, if you’re driving, it might be nice to pull over for a little bit. In any case, just take this moment to fully arrive, giving yourself the gift of a moment of focus and clarity. Letting go of your to-do list. Letting go of whatever comes next. You’re making a clear-eyed commitment to be right here, right now.</p> 
<p>Scan through your own body, checking in and feeling the temperature, so to speak. And you may note whether you feel especially grounded right now, perhaps ungrounded or underground. You don’t have to change anything about that right now, just simply notice.</p>
<p>Now shift your attention inward to your body breathing. Notice inhalations and exhalations wherever they feel most prominent to you. You may feel this most at the tip of your nostrils, where cool air enters the nose and warm breath leaves the mouth. Or you may feel a whole breath that travels from your nose to your throat, into your chest, and down into your belly. </p>
<p>Connect to a few physical sensations. Notice the ones that we can associate with the kinds of energies that we want to work with when showing up with grit and grace. So with your mind’s eye, begin to trace your spine from the tailbone up through the lower back, upper back, back of the neck, and into the crown of the head. And with this, feel the length of your spine. You may even feel as though you’re growing slightly, offering a little more space between the vertebrae and the spine. Allow your head to sit in a balanced way atop of the spine.</p>
<p>As you feel into the length of your spine, note the way that this feels like dignity; a grounded and balanced posture. And then bring your mind’s eye to your back and notice the width of your back. Notice the space from one shoulder to the other, from one underarm to the other. You may even breathe more deeply into the back of the rib cage to access this area. And with your width, feel into your strength. Associating this expanse of the body with strength and grit, focus, and determination. </p>
<p>Now, shift your attention to the front of the chest, right at the breastbone. Your mind’s eye may at first see just a small spot. See if you can focus on the space around that spot; taking in the whole chest. Feel into your heart beating below the breastbone and feel into your warmth. Feel into the energy that is calm and caring and inviting. And, let’s call that your grace. </p>
<p>Once again, notice the length of your spine and the feeling of dignity. Notice the breadth of your back, your strength, and your grit. Notice the warmth in the front of your chest, the heart, and your grace. And allow these three sensations to be in conversation with one another: Dignity, Grit, Grace. 
Take a few deep breaths. Bring a few small movements back to your fingers and toes. If your eyes have been closed, open them. If your eyes have been lowered, you may begin to raise your gaze.</p>", LILI POWELL,Blogs/17.jpg
18,Plate Method,"<p>Previous national food guides, such as Canada's 2007 Food Guide, included target servings of certain foods and specific portion sizes in order to help individuals meet their daily nutrient requirements. While this method can be helpful in certain contexts, for some it can be overwhelming tracking specific numbers. So how can we ensure our meals are nutritionally balanced without tracking numbers? Cue the plate method: an enjoyable way to build nourishing meals. </p>

<p>The plate method was derived from selected national food guidelines including Canada's Updated Food Guide and USA's MyPlate with a few modifications to adapt it for those following a plant-based lifestyle. These guides have been studied and reviewed by experts in the field who have agreed that generally, these proportions meet the general population's estimated macronutrient and micronutrient needs.</p>

<p>The method-
The plate method is a simple visual guide that illustrates the general proportion of each plant-based food group that's needed in order to ensure adequate nutrition. If we regularly include all components of the plate method into meals and rotate the types of foods in each category for variety, we are likely to achieve enough macronutrients (carbohydrates, protein and fat) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals) for optimal health and well-being. It takes the numbers, the tracking, the servings of this and the servings of that out of the equation so that the planning and plating of meals become more effortless. The model takes the shape of a plate, but in reality translates into any type of meal being put together whether it's on a plate, in a bowl, in a sandwich, roll, or wrap.</p>

<p>The philosophy-
The purpose of the plate method is not to meticulously organize our food in an exact orientation, or become hyper-focused on specific fractions for all of our meals, every day. It's designed to be adaptable based on foods that are accessible and enjoyable to each individual. The aim is to include as many of the food groups as is possible for the majority of meals while recognizing that some meals simply won't align with the plate method, and that's ok. If we allow ourselves to be flexible with the method, it makes it more practical and realistic. In this way, we are more likely to stick to it in the long term.  </p>

<p>You may notice that portion sizes are not depicted in the plate method. This is because there is a degree of person-to-person and day-to-day variability that is difficult to represent. The plate method is designed to capture a wide range of nutrients necessary for the majority of the general, healthy population. However, how much we need of these nutrients will vary person-to-person depending on factors including sex, age, weight, and body composition. In addition, each individual's needs may vary day-to-day depending on factors including hunger levels, physical activity, and disease states.</p>",Pickup Limes,Blogs/18.png
19,Recover from Knee Injury,"<p>A major knee injury can be quite debilitating. It may be difficult to move your weight around or perform basic tasks if you’re injured. You may also experience pain and swelling. And if you have a knee injury, you might need surgery.But don’t worry. There are many ways to recover from a major knee injury.</p>


<p>
1. Know the Severity of the Injury
There is a wide range of severity of knee injuries. Someone with a minor knee injury may have a mild ache that goes away after the injury heals.The person may have some swelling, but it doesn’t interfere with their daily life. The other extreme is that someone who has a major knee injury may be unable to walk or stand.They will likely have severe pain and swelling, as well as difficulty moving their weight around.This can make it difficult to perform daily tasks, such as getting dressed or sitting down at a desk. They should contact a health professional if needed.</p>

<p>2. Review Your Activity
To help you recover from a major knee injury, you need to take it easy for some time. You will likely need to take it slow and easy initially as you regain strength in your injured leg.This means that you should avoid activities that involve a lot of weight on your knee. Examples of activities that are good choices include walking and light jogging.When you exercise, you want to make sure that you are doing something, not putting a lot of stress on your knee. For example, don’t do squats, lunges, or any jumping.</p>

<p>3. Visit a Physical Therapist
If you have a knee injury, it’s important to see a physical therapist specializing in treating injuries. Physical therapy for knees and joints can be effective in helping you recover from a knee injury.The physical therapist can help you learn how to perform exercises that will strengthen the muscles in your leg. They can also show you how to do exercises that will help protect your knee when doing activities that put stress on it.</p>

<p>4. Use the RICE Method
The RICE method is a series of steps that you should follow if you have a knee injury. It would be best to start by resting for at least two to four weeks after your injury.You can take it easy and avoid any activities that involve putting stress on your knee.However, if you are an athlete, you need to continue exercising during this period.</p>

<p>5. Apply Ice on the Injured Knee
Ice is one of the first things people use when they have a knee injury. Ice is applied to the injured area to reduce swelling and pain.However, you should not apply ice to your knee for too long or too often. After the first couple of days, it’s best to only use ice on your knee for a few minutes at a time.If you continue using too much ice on your knee, it can cause swelling and discomfort in your knee joint.</p>

<p>6. Take Regular Physical Exams
Physical exams are very important for people who have knee injuries. You should have a physical exam at least once a year.This is important because you can catch any changes in your knee that may result from the injury. You will also be able to see any other injuries you may have sustained.If there are any other injuries, you should see your doctor right away.</p>

<p>7. Maintain Your Knee Cap
You need to maintain your knee cap as much as possible during your recovery period. This is because the knee cap protects your knee joint from damage and injury.The best way to do this is by taking care of your knee cap by using the right type of creams and ointments on it when necessary. You can also have a physical exam done on your knee cap to ensure it is in good condition.</p>

<p>In conclusion, many types of knee injuries can occur, and you need to know what to do when you suffer from one. If you have suffered from a knee injury, you should be able to treat it by yourself with the help of a specialist.However, if you are still unsure about your condition and how to treat it, you should seek professional help. Your specialist will give you the right advice and treatment that you need to recover from your injury.</p>",Taylor Haskings,Blogs/19.jpg
20,Mindful Movement,"<p>The principles of mindful movement are the same as any other mindfulness practice. We aim to bring our full attention to the present moment to experience the here and now. We bring our awareness to our movement and focus on our breath or the way our body feels as it moves. When our mind wanders, we bring our attention back to the practice, to our breath, to our body.</p>

<p>4 Types of Mindful Movement
Breathing exercises are different from when we observe our breath at rest during seated meditation. Instead, we connect with our body by purposefully elongating our breaths to calm our parasympathetic nervous system, or shorten our breaths for short periods of time to refresh and refocus. 
A walking meditation can be a simple and effective way to explore mindful movement. The biggest difference between a walking meditation and going for a walk as we usually would is that when we’re practicing meditation, we aren’t aiming to go anywhere. Instead, we walk slowly and try to bring our full awareness to the act of walking. That can look like focusing on our breath, or feeling the ground beneath our feet as one step turns into the next. When our mind wanders, we bring it back to the sensations of the moment.
Stretching and yoga can help us release tension, stiffness, and heavy emotions. When  our bodies don’t move, they don’t feel good, and neither do our minds. Taking a moment to let go of the day’s distractions, getting away from the desk or couch, and engaging in gentle movement can help us boost our energy, focus, and resilience.
If you’re looking to blow off steam, working out is another opportunity for mindfulness. Getting exercise can be a great way to tune in to our body, synchronize our breath, and be in the moment, all while building strength and nourishing our muscles.</p>

<p>Mindful movement helps us nourish our body by stretching, strengthening and toning, or even just by paying attention and bringing awareness to how our body feels. But we can also use movement to elevate our emotional wellness. When we move our body and adjust the postures in which we hold our body, we also shift the activity of our autonomic nervous system which influences reactions like our heart rate, blood pressure, and fight-or-flight response. This means that mindful movement can give us access to shift our emotions and moods from the outside-in. </p>

<p>Any activity can work for mindful meditation, and you can find anchors for your attention in the motions: Maybe it’s the point when your right hand enters the water while you swim, or the contact of your feet on the pavement as you run. Weight lifters might use the up-and-down repetition of a barbell. Or, you could stick with the one anchor that is always available to you: your breath. Notice as it quickens or slows, and return to it whenever you find your mind drifting to a thought about that text message you forgot to answer, or the milk you accidentally left on the countertop.</p>",MindfulGreen,Blogs/20.jpg
21,A Guide to Sugar,"<p>Sugar is a sneaky little ingredient that's in a considerable amount of foods in many different forms. Despite its delicious and innocent taste, sugar has addictive properties and is linked to a variety of preventable health conditions. Although it's easy to label all sugar as ""bad"", there are types that, when eaten in moderation, may have nutritional benefits.</p>

<p>Types of sugars-
Sugar is a type of carbohydrate found in both food and beverages. Once eaten, sugar is broken down into what's called glucose which is ultimately used for energy. Let's break it down some more with the most common types and examples:Monosaccharides: glucose, galactose, fructose .Disaccharides: sucrose, lactose, maltose.Oligosaccharides: maltodextrin, raffinose.Polyols (sugar alcohols): sorbitol, mannitol, xylitol</p>

<p>Natural vs. added sugars ......
Natural sugars are sugars that are naturally found in foods. These sugars are often found in foods such as fruit, potatoes, yams, and cow's milk.

Added sugars are sugars that are added to foods during processing. These sugars are usually added for preservation, texture, mouthfeel, and taste. Added sugars are often found in foods such as soda/pop beverages, sweetened coffee or tea, cocktails, energy or sports beverages, fruit juice, store-bought cereals, soups, salad dressings, oatmeal, candies, baked goods, ice cream, and pudding. Limiting our intake of added sugars is generally recommended for overall health.

Liquid sweeteners such as maple syrup, blackstrap molasses, agave syrup, and corn syrup are all considered to be sugars too. They contain about the same amount of calories as white sugar and are generally broken down in the same way. Some have trace minerals in very small amounts. Here at PUL, we love to use these sweeteners for their wonderful flavours and consistencies in particular recipes. It's still generally best to still consume them in moderation though.

Coconut sugar-
Coconut sugar is known to have a small trace amount of minerals, but it's nutritionally identical to white granulated sugar. With that being said, it's best to consume coconut sugar at the same level of moderation.

Effects of excess added sugars-
Consuming excess added sugars can contribute to the development of several health effects. Fatigue, weight gain, dental cavities, type 2 diabetes, hypertension, and heart disease have all been linked to excessive intake of sugars.</p>

<p>Artificial Sweeteners-
Artificial sweeteners are sugar substitutes that are zero- or low-calorie alternatives to the sugar options mentioned above. Due to this, companies market their products as ""sugar-free"", ""diet"" or ""no calories"". They're found in many diabetic products because they have little or no effect on blood sugar levels. Some can be made from natural leaf extracts, and some are manufactured. Most artificial sweeteners are also remarkably sweeter when compared to table sugar. This means that smaller amounts can be used to create the same sweetness level. Some examples of artificial sweeteners include acesulfame potassium, aspartame, cyclamate, neotame, saccharin, stevia or steviol, and sucralose.</p>

<p>Considerations with artificial sweeteners-
Conflicting evidence: according to recent high-quality research, artificial sweeteners haven't been linked to health outcomes such as diabetes, kidney disease, high blood pressure, certain cancers or dental health. According to other analyses though, they have been associated with increased BMI and other complications. In short, there are biases and limitations to the studies conducted so far and more research is needed.

Artificial sweeteners as a ""free-pass"": when people consciously know they're having artificial sweeteners with no calories, they may mentally feel able to compensate with something that does have sugar later on. Others may contain them in excess due to the ""low calorie"" or ""no calorie"" label. 

Potential gastrointestinal intolerances: some artificial sweeteners include sugar alcohols, which if consumed in large amounts (say, in a beverage) can have a laxative effect.
</p>

<p>Effects on the brain: consuming artificial sweeteners lights up similar regions of the brain in terms of satisfaction as with all other types of sugar. With this in mind, artificial sweeteners may not actually help curb sugar cravings from the root because we still tend to crave something sweet. In fact, one study suggests that we use sweet taste to predict the calories in a particular food. When our bodies receive these non-caloric sweeteners instead, it realizes the discrepancy and continues to crave, and can potentially eat even more.</p>",PickUp Limes,Blogs/21.jpg
22,Corona Virus Disease,"<p>Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by the SARS-CoV-2 virus.</p>

<p>Most people infected with the virus will experience mild to moderate respiratory illness and recover without requiring special treatment. However, some will become seriously ill and require medical attention. Older people and those with underlying medical conditions like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, chronic respiratory disease, or cancer are more likely to develop serious illness. Anyone can get sick with COVID-19 and become seriously ill or die at any age. </p>

<p>The best way to prevent and slow down transmission is to be well informed about the disease and how the virus spreads. Protect yourself and others from infection by staying at least 1 metre apart from others, wearing a properly fitted mask, and washing your hands or using an alcohol-based rub frequently. Get vaccinated when it’s your turn and follow local guidance.</p>

<p>The virus can spread from an infected person’s mouth or nose in small liquid particles when they cough, sneeze, speak, sing or breathe. These particles range from larger respiratory droplets to smaller aerosols. It is important to practice respiratory etiquette, for example by coughing into a flexed elbow, and to stay home and self-isolate until you recover if you feel unwell.</p>",WHO,Blogs/22.jpg
23,Spices for you Meal,"<p>Herbs and spices can pack a punch, especially when added to your favourite dishes. However, few people realize just how much simple seasonings can benefit their health. From coriander to turmeric, herbs can boost your mental, emotional and physical well-being. Here are a few of the most effective ones and how to use them to spice up your meals.</p>

<p>1. Cilantro-
If you’re looking to add a hint of spice to Mexican or Indian cuisine, try chopped cilantro. This fresh herb is bright green and brimming with health benefits.
Reduce your risk of Alzheimer’s disease, diabetes and Parkinson’s disease with a sprinkle of fresh or dried cilantro. Ground coriander — or cilantro seed — is just as effective when added to meals as it contains linalool, an essential oil that combats anxiety, depression and even insomnia.</p>

<p>2. Chives-
Chives are in the onion family, so they’re sure to add a kick to any meal you use them in. Simply dice up a few thin stalks and use them as a garnish on everything from mashed potatoes to soups to casseroles. They’re also delicious atop sushi and other Asian-inspired cuisines like stir-fry.On top of being downright delicious, chives also happen to make a nutritious addition to your diet. The herb is super rich in specific vitamins and antioxidants that help fight cancer, boost your bone health and improve sleep.</p>

<p>3. Basil-
Perhaps you’ve used basil to make pesto or as a topping on Margherita pizza. This herb is more versatile than most people realize. While it tastes deliciously peppery in practically any Italian recipe, it’s also good in salads, Thai dishes and cocktails. A little goes a long way, so grab a bunch at the grocery store or plant your own herb garden to keep those green leaves growing.</p>



<p>4. Rosemary-
The active ingredient in rosemary is rosmarinic acid, a powerful substance that can do wonders for your sinuses. Got allergies? Try adding some rosemary to a lemon or butter-based chicken dish. The meal will suppress your allergic response and reduce nasal congestion so you can breathe easily and taste what you’re eating.Rosemary is also rich in antioxidants and anti-inflammatory compounds, which can boost circulation and improve the immune system. Even the aroma of this potent herb can improve your mood and clear the mind. Feel free to open the oven and take in a few big whiffs as dinner cooks.</p>

<p>5. Sage-
Sage has a strong reputation for its healing properties. Many people even burn dried bundles of the herb within their homes to cleanse the space and promote wisdom. The ancient Romans and Egyptians used it to treat digestive issues, memory problems and sore throats, so it makes sense that sage is still a popular herb today.Sage complements a wide variety of flavours, especially during the fall. Autumn flavours in dishes like roasted butternut squash, pumpkin lasagna and grilled cheese all pair well with a sprinkle of dried sage. Some meats, including turkey and sea bass, also taste better with a pinch of this delicious herb.</p>

<p>6. Turmeric-
If you’ve ever had Indian food, you’ve likely tried turmeric. This bright yellow spice is a staple in many Eastern cultures, and just a spoonful is enough to tinge an entire pot of soup, rice or golden milk a beautiful sunny hue. It also adds a pungent, earthy-sweet taste to practically any dish.



<p>7. Peppermint-
Peppermint should be your go-to herb of choice when you want to freshen your breath or brighten up a spring salad. Aside from using it to make tea or refreshingly delicious cocktails, you can use mint in pestos, dukkah, pasta, fritters and more. When in doubt, add a sprig atop fruity or chocolatey desserts to really make your taste buds tingle.</p>

<p>Eating this herb can calm irritable bowel syndrome and relieve indigestion, whether you sip mint tea or consume the plant’s leaves. It’s also high in iron, vitamin A and antioxidants, like many other leafy green herbs on this list.

<p>Adding More Healthy Herbs to Your Diet-
Adding healthy herbs to your diet doesn’t have to be difficult. In fact, most will complement a wide variety of dishes, so there’s certainly room for experimentation.

24,A Guide to Cancer,"<p>Cancer begins in your cells, which are the building blocks of your body. Normally, your body forms new cells as you need them, replacing old cells that die. Sometimes this process goes wrong. New cells grow even when you don't need them, and old cells don't die when they should. These extra cells can form a mass called a tumor. Tumors can be benign or malignant. Benign tumors aren't cancer while malignant ones are. Cells from malignant tumors can invade nearby tissues. They can also break away and spread to other parts of the body.</p>

<p>Cancer is not just one disease but many diseases. There are more than 100 different types of cancer. Most cancers are named for where they start. For example, lung cancer starts in the lung, and breast cancer starts in the breast. The spread of cancer from one part of the body to another is called metastasis. Symptoms and treatment depend on the cancer type and how advanced it is. Most treatment plans may include surgery, radiation and/or chemotherapy. Some may involve hormone therapy, immunotherapy or other types of biologic therapy, or stem cell transplantation.</p>",MediLine Plus,Blogs/24.jpg
25,Plant Based Diet,"<p>Dropping the phrase “plant-based diet” is hip when talking nutrition these days. But why is it so hot right now? Lauren Manaker, RDN, who is based in Charleston, South Carolina, suspects it’s because of increased awareness of the health and environmental benefits that come along with eating this way. Some of that could be the result of documentaries that throw shade at eating meat and other animal products, such as What the Health (2017), Cowspiracy (2014), and Forks Over Knives (2011).But what does “plant-based diet” mean, anyway? Is it the same thing as being vegetarian or vegan? Or does this diet just mean you make an effort to pack more veggies into your meals?</p>

<p>Technically, all of the above interpretations are correct. “Some people use the term ‘plant-based diet’ as a synonym for the vegan diet,” says Summer Yule, RDN, a nutritionist based in Hartford, Connecticut. “Others may use the term in a broader way that includes all vegetarian diets, and I’ve also seen people use ‘plant-based’ to mean diets that are composed mostly, but not entirely, of plant foods.”</p>

<p>The main idea is to make plant-based foods the central part of your meals. “A plant-based diet emphasizes foods like fruits, vegetables, and beans, and limits foods like meats, dairy, and eggs,” Manaker says. From there, more restrictions could be put in place depending on how strict you want to be. “It may completely eliminate foods from animals or just limit intake, depending on the individual’s interpretation,” Manaker says.That means meat and seafood don’t necessarily need to be off-limits — you might just decide to cut down on how frequently you eat those items.</p>

<p>Think of “plant-based” as a broad category of diets, with other more specific diets falling under its umbrella. For example, the Mediterranean diet is a version of a plant-based diet because even though it incorporates fish and poultry, the emphasis is on plant-based foods, Manaker says.Vegetarian and vegan diets are also plant-based. (1) Whole30, a popular diet and lifestyle plan, doesn’t usually qualify. “The Whole30 diet traditionally is heavier on animal proteins, though it is possible to follow this diet in a plant-based way,” </p>", Moira Lawler,Blogs/25.jpg
