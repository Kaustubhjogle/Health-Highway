# Health Highway

The application aims to bridge the gap between medical services in rural areas and major health centers. It provides temporary treatment solutions to increase the survival time of patients before they can reach proper medical facilities.

The target users are medical servants working in rural areas who may lack experience in dealing with complex diseases. The application connects these servants directly to doctors through video conferencing and provides video lectures for guidance. 

It features a database with symptoms, solutions, and video lectures for various diseases. In emergency situations, direct connection to doctors is available.
